## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Create `scripts/train.py` to load data, train, and save model + labels
- [ ] 1.2 Create `app.py` (Streamlit) to serve model inference
- [ ] 1.3 Add `requirements.txt` listing necessary Python packages
- [ ] 1.4 Add basic usage docs to the proposal or README (how to train and run app)

## 2. Validation
- [ ] 2.1 Run a local smoke run of `scripts/train.py` on a small sample (1 epoch)
- [ ] 2.2 Launch `streamlit run app.py` and verify image upload + prediction flow

## 3. Cleanup
- [ ] 3.1 Ensure `models/` and large artifacts are `.gitignore`d
- [ ] 3.2 Mark tasks complete and request review
